# CloudFlare DDNS

Dynamic DNS client for use with CloudFlare for windows.

#### GOAL
I want an application that runs as a windows service and quietly keeps the designated subdomain updated with the current public ip address.  This application is forked from another application and has a long way to go in order to make it work for my use-case.

## Requirements
Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 or Windows Server 2008R2/2012/2012R2
.NET 4.0 or above (4.5 already installed with Windows 8 / 8.1)


## Execution
On first launch, enter your details in Tools->Options. 
You will need your CloudFlare API key, available on your CloudFlare Account page.
